This is Kurt Newcomb

Still not super confident with Git, as I always seem to have a issues, but anyways, hopefully this all works and you can get to it and everything.

If there's anything I did wrong please let me know...

Fun fact about me I guess, since you asked for a brief introduction...  I consistently get told by random strangers who have just met me that I seem like an amazing person, without any sort of prompting whatsoever... a random nurse, a random lady at the Rubio's I was eating at a couple weeks ago, they both just chimed in out of the blue and said, "You seem like an amazing person"...  but I don't like it when people say things like that about me, because it puts too much pressure on it... I think you should just "be" and by doing so, your aren't doing it for fame and glory or anything, you are just being you...
